# Basic-Licence-Server-Go

This is a simple license server written in Go, comprising three main components:

License Server: This section hosts the APIs and handles the verification process.
License Client: It is used to test necessary verifications and utilize the licenses.
Key Generation: This part deals with generating keys.
An ORM-based GORM library compatible with Go has been used for the database. When the code runs for the first time, it automatically creates the .db file and the table structures inside it.
